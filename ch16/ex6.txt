data Tree = Leaf Int | Node Tree Tree

countNodes (Leaf _) = 0
countNodes (Node l r) = countNodes l + 1 + countNodes r

countLeaves (Leaf _) = 1
countLeaves (Node l r) = countLeaves l + countLeaves r

prove countNodes Tree + 1 == countLeaves Tree

Base case:
countNodes (Leaf _) + 1
= {applying countNodes}
0 + 1
= {applying +}
1
= {unapplying countLeaves}
countLeaves (Leaf _)

Inductive case:
countNodes (Node l r) + 1
= {applying countNodes}
countNodes l + 1 + countNodes r + 1
= {induction hypothesis for countNodes l}
countLeaves l + countNodes r + 1
= {induction hypothesis for countNodes r}
countLeaves l + countLeaves r
= {unapplying countLeaves}
countLeaves (Node l r)
